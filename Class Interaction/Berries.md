# Abstract classes and Interfaces 

Here in both examples of code, a mock "Berry Irs" is taking a percentage of berries collected. both an Interface and abstract class are used to calculate how many berries are owed to said berry irs and more importantly  how many years in jail the user will face if said percentage is not admitted to them.
