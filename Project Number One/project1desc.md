# PROJECT ONE

in this project the system will take input from a user and print out the information collected in the form of bricks of pokemon information.

1. First the system asks the user to input an odd number of rounds.

2. Then the system goes through the process of asking the user to input specific information relating to the pokemon such as name, speed, ect.
3. Then the system takes the speed of the dara collected and compares the two inputs to determine which pokemon goes first, after which the pokemons power is subtracted from the other pokemons health.
4. If a pokemons health is reduced to 0 or below said integer, the system will print out that one side has won, then add a point to that players counter
5. This process repeats until all rounds are over, then the system will display who ever has more points as the winner.
